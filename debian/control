Description: Dump Windows 2k/NT/XP password hashes
 This tool is designed to dump Windows 2k/NT/XP password hashes from a SAM
 file, using the syskey bootkey from the system hive.
 .
 This package also provides the functionality of bkhive, which recovers the
 syskey bootkey from a Windows NT/2K/XP system hive.
 .
 Syskey is a Windows feature that adds an additional encryption layer to the
 password hashes stored in the SAM database.
